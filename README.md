# README Generator 

## Description

This command-line application dynamically generates a professional README.md for any project from user's input using the inquirer package. The user will be prompted with a series of questions (ie title of proj, contact info, licence info, etc), and afterwards, the following information will be added to the corresponding sections of the README. Moreover, when the user selects a licence for their project, a badge for that licence will be displayed at the top.
